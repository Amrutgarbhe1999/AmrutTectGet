                    <p class="lead">Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of data or computer
                        instructions that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast to physical hardware, from
                        which the system is built and actually performs the work. In computer science and software
                        engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and
                        data. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data,
                        such as online documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require each other
                        and neither can be realistically used on its own.

                        At the lowest programming level,[clarification needed] executable code consists of machine
                        language instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit
                        (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU). A machine language consists of groups of binary
                        values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its
                        preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage
                        location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction
                        may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example displaying some text on a
                        computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the user. </p>
