                                    <p class="card-text">In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes
                                        called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in
                                        contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI
                                        textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that
                                        perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of
                                        successfully achieving its goals.Colloquially, the term "artificial
                                        intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic
                                        "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as
                                        "learning" and "problem solving"

                                        As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require
                                        "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known
                                        as the AI effect. A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been
                                        done yet.For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded
                                        from things considered to be AI,having become a routine technology.Modern
                                        machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully
                                        understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game
                                        systems (such as chess and Go)autonomously operating cars, intelligent
                                        routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">Robotics is an interdisciplinary research area at the interface
                                        of computer science and engineering[1]. Robotics involves design, construction,
                                        operation, and use of robots. The goal of robotics is to design intelligent
                                        machines that can help and assist humans in their day-to-day lives and keep
                                        everyone safe. Robotics draws on the achievement of information engineering,
                                        computer engineering, mechanical engineering, electronic engineering and others.

                                        Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human
                                        actions. Robots can be used in many situations and for many purposes, but today
                                        many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection of radioactive
                                        materials, bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where
                                        humans cannot survive (e.g. in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and
                                        containment of hazardous materials and radiation). Robots can take on any form
                                        but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the
                                        acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by
                                        people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or
                                        any other human activity. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature,
                                        contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.Robotics is a branch of
                                        engineering that involves the conception, design,
                                        manufacture, and operation of robots. This field overlaps with computer
                                        engineering, computer science (especially artificial intelligence), electronics,
                                        mechatronics, nanotechnology and bioengineering.

                                    <p class="card-text">Virtual Reality (VR) immerses the user in an environment while
                                        Augment Reality (AR) enhances their environment. Although VR has primarily been
                                        used for gaming thus far, it has also been used for training, as with
                                        VirtualShip, a simulation software used to train U.S. Navy, Army, and Coast
                                        Guard ship captains. The popular Pokemon Go is an example of AR.

                                        Both VR and AR have enormous potential in training, entertainment, education,
                                        marketing, and even rehabilitation after an injury. Either could be used to
                                        train doctors to do surgery, offer museum-goers a deeper experience, enhance
                                        theme parks, or even enhance marketing, as with this Pepsi Max bus shelter.

                                        There are major players in the VR market, like Google, Samsung, and Oculus, but
                                        plenty of startups are forming and they will be hiring, and the demand for
                                        professionals with VR and AR skills will only increase. Getting started in VR
                                        doesn’t require a lot of specialized knowledge. Basic programming skills and a
                                        forward-thinking mindset can land a job, although other employers will be
                                        looking for optics as a skill-set and hardware engineers as well.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">While we still aren’t at the stage where we can expect to
                                        routinely travel in, or even see, autonomous vehicles in 2020, they will
                                        undoubtedly continue to generate a significant amount of excitement.

                                        Tesla chief Elon Musk has said he expects his company to create a truly
                                        “complete” autonomous vehicle by this year, and the number of vehicles capable
                                        of operating with a lesser degree of autonomy – such as automated braking and
                                        lane-changing – will become an increasingly common sight. In addition to this,
                                        other in-car systems not directly connected to driving, such as security and
                                        entertainment functions – will become increasingly automated and reliant on data
                                        capture and analytics. Google's sister-company Waymo has just completed a trial
                                        of autonomous taxis in California, where it transported more than 6200 people in
                                        the first month.

                                        It won’t just be cars, of course – trucking and shipping are becoming more
                                        autonomous, and breakthroughs in this space are likely to continue to hit the
                                        headlines throughout 2020.

                                        With the maturing of autonomous driving technology, we will also increasingly
                                        hear about the measures that will be taken by regulators, legislators, and
                                        authorities. Changes to laws, existing infrastructure, and social attitudes are
                                        all likely to be required before autonomous driving becomes a practical reality
                                        for most of us. During 2020, it's likely we will start to see the debate around
                                        autonomous driving spread outside of the tech world, as more and more people
                                        come round to the idea that the question is not "if," but "when," it will become
                                        a reality.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Technology is currently transforming healthcare at an unprecedented
                                    rate. Our ability to capture data from wearable devices such as smartwatches will
                                    give us the ability to increasingly predict and treat health issues in people even
                                    before they experience any symptoms.

                                    When it comes to treatment, we will see much more personalized approaches. This is
                                    also referred to as precision medicine which allows doctors to more precisely
                                    prescribe medicines and apply treatments, thanks to a data-driven understanding of
                                    how effective they are likely to be for a specific patient.

                                    Although not a new idea, thanks to recent breakthroughs in technology, especially in
                                    the fields of genomics and AI, it is giving us a greater understanding of how
                                    different people’s bodies are better or worse equipped to fight off specific
                                    diseases, as well as how they are likely to react to different types of medication
                                    or treatment.

                                    Throughout 2020 we will see new applications of predictive healthcare and the
                                    introduction of more personalized and effective treatments to ensure better outcomes
                                    for individual patients.

                                    Computer Vision

                                    In computer terms, “vision” involves systems that are able to identify items,
                                    places, objects or people from visual images – those collected by a camera or
                                    sensor. It’s this technology that allows your smartphone camera to recognize which
                                    part of the image it's capturing is a face, and powers technology such as Google
                                    Image Search.

                                    As we move through 2020, we’re going to see computer vision equipped tools and
                                    technology rolled out for an ever-increasing number of uses. It’s fundamental to the
                                    way autonomous cars will “see” and navigate their way around danger. Production
                                    lines will employ computer vision cameras to watch for defective products or
                                    equipment failures, and security cameras will be able to alert us to anything out of
                                    the ordinary, without requiring 24/7 monitoring.

                                    Computer vision is also enabling face recognition, which we will hear a lot about in
                                    2020. We have already seen how useful the technology is in controlling access to our
                                    smartphones in the case of Apple's FaceID and how Dubai airport uses it to provide a
                                    smoother customer journey. However, as the use cases will grow in 2020, we will also
                                    have more debates about limiting the use of this technology because of its potential
                                    to erode privacy and enable 'Big Brother'-like state control.

                                    Extended Reality

                                    Extended Reality (XR) is a catch-all term that covers several new and emerging
                                    technologies being used to create more immersive digital experiences. More
                                    specifically, it refers to virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Virtual reality
                                    (VR) provides a fully digitally immersive experience where you enter a
                                    computer-generated world using headsets that blend out the real world. Augmented
                                    reality (AR) overlays digital objects onto the real world via smartphone screens or
                                    displays (think Snapchat filters). Mixed reality (MR) is an extension of AR, that
                                    means users can interact with digital objects placed in the real world (think
                                    playing a holographic piano that you have placed into your room via an AR headset).
