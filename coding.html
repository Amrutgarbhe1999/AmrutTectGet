                        <h2>Python </h2>
                        <p> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido
                            van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code
                            readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
                            object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and
                            large-scale projects.[28]

                            Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming
                            paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional
                            programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its
                            comprehensive standard library.[29]

                            Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0,
                            released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection
                            system with reference counting.</p>

                        <h2>Java</h2>
                        <p>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and
                            designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let
                            application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code
                            can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java
                            applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine
                            (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C
                            and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one
                            of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly
                            for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]

                            Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been
                            acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java
                            platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and
                            class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. </p>

                        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                        <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
                            conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time
                            compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
                            object-orientation, and first-class functions.

                            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8]
                            JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The
                            vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web
                            browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

                            As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
                            programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
                            dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                            However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking,
                            storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides
                            those APIs.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer
                        program to accomplish a specific computing result. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis,
                        generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the
                        implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as
                        coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are
                        intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central
                        processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will
                        automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a
                        computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires
                        expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
                        specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

                        Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code
                        maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the
                        machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process,
                        but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term
                        programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software
                        engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse
                        engineering is the opposite process. A hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their
                        technical knowledge to overcome a problem, but it can also mean a security hacker in common
                        language.
